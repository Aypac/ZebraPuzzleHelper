# Zebra Puzzle Helper
Class representation of a zebra puzzle to help you efficiently solve [zebra puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) like [Einstein's puzzle](http://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html).

This is will plain solve these type of puzzles for you, but they at least provide a framework to really efficiently solve them, without applying the purely mechanical parts (i.e. doing the simple logic conclusions required).

The documentation is still rather bad, but there is an iPython notebook which contains an example on how to use this class.

Created and tested with python 3.7
